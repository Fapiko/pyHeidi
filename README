pyHeidi is an open source project to create a clone of the popular SQL client HeidiSQL in Python. After using HeidiSQL, I have found all other MySQL GUI clients to be clunky or lacking features. I've chosen to port it to Python as I've recently made the move to Ubuntu on my work machine and need a cross-platform GUI SQL client, and this seems like a good learning project for Python.
